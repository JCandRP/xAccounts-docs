# What are xAccounts?

xAccounts are an implementation standard for creating xChain accounts, a method of setting up accounts on chain A that are controlled by an account on chain B. Built using the Wormhole messaging bridge, xAccounts form the 4th building block of Wormhole followed by xAssets, xApps, and xData.&#x20;

v1 xAccount operations are all assumed to be asynchronous and non-atomic. Future iterations could utilize batch VAAs to achieve atomic execution.
